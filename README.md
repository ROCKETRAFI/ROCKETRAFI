## 🚀 About Me  
I'm a developer who enjoys building real-world applications that combine *AI, **web/mobile development, and **system automation*.  
I’m currently working on AI chatbots, mobile apps, and automation tools, and interning as a *Web Developer & Mobile App Developer* for the SF Living Wage Coalition.

I love exploring how AI can make products more personalized — especially in social and relationship-based applications.
